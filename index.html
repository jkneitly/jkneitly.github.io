          <p>     The publication of Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe in 1719 sparked a wildfire of copies, <br>parodies, and derivative texts. Re-utilizing Crusoe’s tropes was so conspicuous that the phrase that critics coined the phrase ‘Robinsonade’ to identify these works. The Robinsonade canon continues to grow into contemporary times and across genres including feature films such works as Tom Hanks’ Castaway (2000) and the Matt Damon’s The Martian (2015). Critics and readers applied the term Robinsonade notoriously to any text featuring a castaway(s) and survival in exotic locales. These works combine personal narrative, religious discovery, survival, strange locales, wild animals, natives/Indigenous populations, and other tropes to appeal to the average reader. However, these palatable narratives sometimes contain valuable social critiques. History has forgotten works with literary and scholarly merit after the public has applied the label, Robinsonade. Labeled as derivative, The Female American; or, The Adventures of Unca Eliza Winkfield  almost lost its place in history.
